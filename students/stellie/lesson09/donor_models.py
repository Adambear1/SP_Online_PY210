class Donor(object):
    # Class responsible for donor data encapsulation

    # This class will hold all the information about a single donor, and have
    # attributes, properties, and methods to provide access to the donor-
    # specific information that is needed. Any code that only accesses
    # information about a single donor should be part of this class.
    pass


class DonorCollection(object):
    # Class responsible for donor collection data encapsulation

    # This class will hold all of the donor objects, as well as methods to add
    # a new donor, search for a given donor, etc. If you want a way to save and
    # re-load your data, this class would hold that method, too.

    # Your class for the collection of donors will also hold the code that
    # generates reports about multiple donors.
