# Write a program which prints the full path for all files in the current directory, one per lined

    print(os.path.abspath(os.getcwd()) + filename)

# Write a program which copies a file from a source, to a destination (without using shutil, or
# the OS copy command).
# Advanced: make it work for any size file: i.e. donâ€™t read the entire contents of the file into
# memory at once.

Bonus: very large binary file copy speeds.

run > cat /dev/random > ./large_file (hit ctrl-c after about 10 seconds)
Yields this:
-rw-r--r--  1 jamesbutts  staff   534M May  1 18:05 large_file
... full of randomness. 

I initially started reading byte-by-byte but that was agonizingly slow. Taking chunks closer to the 
block size of the filesystem, in my case 4096 bytes, allowed the copy to complete in under 1 second.
 The sweet spot seemed to be 2048 on my system.

Results:

block size of 512 bytes: 0:00:00.609085
block size of 1024 bytes: 0:00:00.620046
block size of 2048 bytes: 0:00:00.610354
block size of 4096 bytes: 0:00:00.602073
block size of 8192 bytes: 0:00:00.614088
block size of 16384 bytes: 0:00:00.606930
block size of 32768 bytes: 0:00:00.626366

print("\n\nRunning multiple tests of a large binary file with different block sizes:\n")
print("{} {:.2f} MB\n".format(os.path.basename(LARGE_FILE), os.stat(LARGE_FILE).st_size / 1048576))

for block_size in BLOCK_SIZES:
    os.remove(LARGE_FILE_COPY) # delete the file so it's hopefully not cached by the os.

File reading and parsing

Download this text file:

students.txt

In it, you will find a list of names and what programming languages they have used in the past. 
This may be similar to a list generated at the beginning of this class.

Write a little script that reads that file, and generates a list of all the languages that have 
been used.
