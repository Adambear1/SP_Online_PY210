"""Lesson 02 | Fibonacci Series Exercise"""
# The Fibonacci Series is a numeric series starting with the integers 0 and 1.
# In this series, the next integer is determined by summing the previous two.
#
# This gives us: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...
# We will write a function that computes this series â€“ then generalize it.

# fib(n) = fib(n-2) + fib(n-1)

def fibonacci(n):
    """ compute the nth Fibonacci number """
    # pass
    return sum_series(n,0,1)

def lucas(n):
    """ compute the nth Lucas number """
    # pass
    return sum_series(n,2,1)

def sum_series(n, n0=0, n1=1):
    """
    compute the nth value of a summation series.

    :param n0=0: value of zeroth element in the series
    :param n1=1: value of first element in the series

    This function should generalize the fibonacci() and the lucas(),
    so that this function works for any first two numbers for a sum series.
    Once generalized that way, sum_series(n, 0, 1) should be equivalent to fibonacci(n).
    And sum_series(n, 2, 1) should be equivalent to lucas(n).
