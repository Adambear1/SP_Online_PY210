Hi there, my name is Deniss and I am originally from Latvia, a small Baltic country.  This is actually why the spelling of my name is unusual  :D
I was interested in learning Python for quite some time now and finally have some time to do so!  Learning Python will be a great benefit for my personal and professional future.
