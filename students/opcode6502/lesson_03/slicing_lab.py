# Write some functions that take a sequence as an argument, and return a copy of that sequence:
# REQ-01: with the first and last items exchanged.
# REQ-02: with every other item removed.
# REQ-03: with the first 4 and the last 4 items removed, and then every other item in the remaining sequence.
# REQ-04: with the elements reversed (just with slicing).
# REQ-05: with the last third, then first third, then the middle third in the new order.
# REQ-06: Write a test or two like that for each of the above functions.
