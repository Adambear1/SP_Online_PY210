# REQ-01: Series 1: Create a list that contains “Apples”, “Pears”, “Oranges” and “Peaches”.


# REQ-02: Display the list (plain old print() is fine…).


# REQ-03: Ask the user for another fruit and add it to the end of the list.


# REQ-04: Display the list.


# REQ-05: Ask the user for a number and display the number back to the user and the fruit corresponding to that number (on a 1-is-first basis). Remember that Python uses zero-based indexing, so you will need to correct.


# REQ-06: Add another fruit to the beginning of the list using “+” and display the list.


# REQ-07: Add another fruit to the beginning of the list using insert() and display the list.


# REQ-08: Display all the fruits that begin with “P”, using a for loop.


# Series 2
# Using the list created in series 1 above:


# REQ-09: Display the list.


# REQ-10: Remove the last fruit from the list.


# REQ-XX: Display the list.


# REQ-XX: Ask the user for a fruit to delete, find it and delete it.
# (Bonus: Multiply the list times two. Keep asking until a match is found. Once found, delete all occurrences.)


# Series 3
# Again, using the list from series 1:


# REQ-XX: Ask the user for input displaying a line like “Do you like apples?” for each fruit in the list (making the fruit all lowercase).


# REQ-XX: For each “no”, delete that fruit from the list.


# REQ-XX: For any answer that is not “yes” or “no”, prompt the user to answer with one of those two values (a while loop is good here)


# REQ-XX: Display the list.


# Series 4
# Once more, using the list from series 1:


# REQ-XX: Make a new list with the contents of the original, but with all the letters in each item reversed.


# REQ-XX: Delete the last item of the original list. Display the original list and the copy.
