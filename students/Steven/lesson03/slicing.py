'''
Write some functions that take a sequence as an argument, and return a copy of that sequence:

* with the first and last items exchanged.
* with every other item removed.
* with the first 4 and the last 4 items removed, and then every other item in the remaining sequence.
* with the elements reversed (just with slicing).
* with the last third, then first third, then the middle third in the new order.

NOTE: These should work with ANY sequence â€“ but you can use strings to test, if you like.
